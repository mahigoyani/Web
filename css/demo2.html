        <h3>what is socialmedia</h3>
        <p class="intro">Social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share,
            and/or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. The Office of Communications and
            Marketing manages the main Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube accoun</p>
        <p class="intro">ARPANET, which first came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s developed a rich cultural
            exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the network etiquette (or
            'netiquette') described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[14]
            ARPANET evolved into the Internet following the publication of the first Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
            specification, RFC 675 (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), written by Vint Cerf, Yogen
            Dalal, and Carl Sunshine in 1974.[15] This became the foundation of Usenet, conceived by Tom Truscott and
            Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, and established in
            1980.</p>

        <h2>facebook</h2>
        <p class="intro">Facebook is a website which allows users, who sign-up for free profiles, to connect with
            friends, work colleagues or people they don't know, online. It allows users to share pictures, music,
            videos, and articles, as well as their own thoughts and opinions with however many people they like.</p>
        <p class="intro">Access to Facebook is free of charge, and the company earns most of its money from
            advertisements on the website. New users can create profiles, upload photos, join a preexisting group, and
            start new groups. The site has many components, including Timeline, a space on each user’s profile page
            where users can post their content and friends can post messages; Status, which enables users to alert
            friends to their current location or situation; and News Feed, which informs users of changes to their
            friends’ profiles and status. Users can chat with each other and send each other private messages. Users can
            signal their approval of content on Facebook with the Like button, a feature that also appears on many other
            websites. Other services that are part of Meta Platforms are Instagram, a photo- and video-sharing social
            network; Messenger, an instant-messaging application; and WhatsApp, a text-message and VoIP service.
            Facebook, American online social network service that is part of the company Meta Platforms. Facebook was
            founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, all of whom were
            students at Harvard University. </p>

        <h2>instagram</h2>
        <p class="intro">Instagram[a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service owned by American company
            Meta Platforms. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by
            hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can
            browse other users' content by tag and location, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users
            to add their content to a personal feed.[7]</p>
        <p class="intro">Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1)
            aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction
            was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple
            images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which
            allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours.
            As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[7]

            Originally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained
            popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June
            2018.[8] In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.
            The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November
            2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40
            billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also
            been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged
            censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.</p>

        <h2>youtube</h2>
        <p class="intro">YouTube is a global online video sharing and social media platform headquartered in San Bruno,
            California. It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned
            by Google, and is the second most visited website, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion
            monthly users[7] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day.[8] As of May 2019,
            videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[9][10]</p>
        <p class="intro">In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[11] Google's ownership of
            YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone, to
            offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube
            Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to
            participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube
            reported revenue of $19.8 billion in 2020.[12] In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to
            $28.8 billion.[1]

            Since its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network
            television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos,
            video clips, news, short films, feature films, documentaries, audio recordings, movie trailers, teasers,
            live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between
            YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros.
            Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a larger audience.

            YouTube has had an unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating
            multimillionaire celebrities. Despite all its growth and success, YouTube has been widely criticized.
            Criticism of YouTube includes the website being used to facilitate the spread of misinformation, copyright
            issues, routine violations of its users' privacy, enabling censorship, their guidelines and how they are
            implemented, and endangering child safety and wellbeing.</p>

        <h2>snapchat</h2>
        <p class="intro">Snapchat can be an intimidating social network to learn, which is partly by design. The app
            employs a user experience principal known as shareable design, which holds that an app is best learned when
            a friend explains it to you. This strategy appears to be working in Snapchat’s favor – over 2.5 billion
            snaps are posted on Snapchat every day.</p>
        <p class="intro">Content on Snapchat begins with Snaps, which are photos or short videos shot and edited from
            within the app. Fun editing features can be used to enhance your snaps, such as selfie lenses, which
            transform you into fun characters, or geo-filters, which appear based on the location you’re in, and
            stickers, drawing, and text tools to add extra flair to your image. Unsurprisingly, the resulting real time
            content shared by users tends to be lighthearted and casual.
            Snapchat also includes a Stories feature, which lets you publish a collection of Snaps that can be viewed by
            other Snapchat users, and a search feature, which allows users to easily find other stories within the app,
            which is particularly valuable for brands looking to build a following.</p>

        <h2>telegram</h2>
        <p class="intro">Telegram Messenger is a globally accessible freemium, cross-platform, encrypted, cloud-based
            and centralized instant messaging (IM) service. The application also provides optional end-to-end encrypted
            chats, popularly known as secret chat and video calling,[10] VoIP, file sharing and several other features.
            It was launched for iOS on 14 August 2013 and Android on 20 October 2013. The servers of Telegram are
            distributed worldwide with five data centers in different parts of the world, while the operational center
            is based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.[11][12][13][14] Various client apps are available for desktop and
            mobile platforms including official apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux (although registration
            requires an iOS or Android device and a working phone number).[15][16][17] There are also two official
            Telegram web twin apps, WebK and WebZ,[18] and numerous unofficial clients that make use of Telegram's
            protocol. Telegram's official components are open source,[19] with the exception of the server which is
            closed-sourced and proprietary.[8]</p>
        <p class="intro">Telegram provides optional end-to-end encrypted chats. Cloud chats and groups are encrypted
            between the client and the server, so that ISPs and other third-parties on the network can't access data.
            Users can send text and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share an unlimited number of images,
            documents (2 GB per file), user locations, animated stickers, contacts, and audio files. Users can also
            follow channels.[20]

            In January 2021, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users.[21] It was the most downloaded app
            worldwide in January 2021[22][23] with 1 billion downloads globally as of late August 2021. Research
            suggests that the Telegram surge in January 2021 was driven partly by the deplatforming of Parler by
            big-tech firms.[24] In June 2022, Telegram surpassed 700 million monthly active users.[25][26] The same
            month, Telegram Premium, an optional paid subscription with several extra features, was introduced.</p><br><br><br>
